                <h3>What is Onigiri?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Onigiri (also known as <em>o-musubi</em> or <em>nigirmeshi</em>) is a traditional Japanese snack that is made by shaping cooked rice into a triangular or cylindrical shape and usually wrapping it with a strip of nori seaweed. Onigiri is often filled with various ingredients such as salted salmon, tuna, pickled plum, or other savory items. It's a convenient snack that is easy to make and is often eaten as a quick meal or snack on the go.

                    The history of onigiri can be traced back to the eighth century when rice cultivation became prevalent in Japan. The Japanese would shape leftover rice into small balls as a portable snack that could be eaten while traveling or working in the fields. This rice ball snack was originally known as tonjiki and was made without any filling or seasoning.

                    In the late sixteenth century, onigiri began to take on its current form. Samurai warriors would carry onigiri with them as a portable snack during battles. They would often wrap the onigiri with nori seaweed, which not only added flavor but also acted as a natural preservative.
                    <br><br>
                    Over time, onigiri became a popular snack in Japan, and various fillings and seasonings were added to the rice balls. Today, onigiri can be found in a variety of flavors and shapes, and it remains a staple snack in Japan, enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol class="info-list ol-list">
                    <li>Rinse the rice in cold water until the water becomes clear. Drain the rice and let it soak in the water for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In a pot, combine the rice and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the rice simmer for 15-20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove the pot from heat and let it sit for 10 minutes. Remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork.</li>
                    <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt over medium heat. Stir until the sugar and salt dissolve.</li>
                    <li>Pour the vinegar mixture over the rice and mix well. Let the rice cool down to room temperature.</li>
                    <li>Wet your hands with water to prevent the rice from sticking, and scoop a small amount of rice (about 1/4 cup) into your palm.</li>
                    <li>Make a small indentation in the center of the rice and add a small amount of filling. Cover the filling with more rice and shape the rice into a triangle or cylinder.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle furikake on the onigiri and wrap it with a small piece of nori seaweed. Repeat until all the rice and filling are used up.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Enjoy your homemade onigiri as a delicious snack or meal!</p>
