                <h3>What is Ramen?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup dish that is typically made with wheat noodles, a savory broth, and various toppings such as sliced pork, bamboo shoots, nori seaweed, and soft-boiled eggs. The dish has its roots in Chinese-style wheat noodles, but it has been adapted and developed into a unique and popular Japanese cuisine.

                    The noodles used in ramen are typically made with wheat flour, salt, and water, and they come in various thicknesses and textures depending on the regional style. The broth is usually made with a combination of meat, fish, and/or vegetable stock, and it can be flavored with soy sauce, miso, or salt.

                    Ramen can be served in many different styles, such as shoyu (soy sauce-based), shio (salt-based), tonkotsu (pork bone-based), and miso (soybean paste-based), among others. The toppings can also vary widely, with popular choices including sliced pork belly, soft-boiled eggs, nori seaweed, and green onions.
                    <br><br>  
                    Ramen has become a popular dish around the world, with many different variations and interpretations available in different regions. It's often enjoyed as a comforting and hearty meal, particularly in colder weather, but it can be enjoyed any time of year.</p>
