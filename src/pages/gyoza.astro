                <h3>What is Gyoza?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Gyoza is a type of Japanese dumpling that is typically filled with ground meat (often pork), vegetables, and seasonings. The filling is then wrapped in a thin dough wrapper and pan-fried or steamed until cooked through. Gyoza is often served as an appetizer or side dish, and it's a popular menu item at Japanese restaurants around the world.
                    <br><br>
                    Gyoza originated in China, where they are known as jiaozi, but they have been adapted and developed into a unique Japanese cuisine. The Japanese version of gyoza is typically smaller and more delicate than their Chinese counterparts, and they're often served with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, rice vinegar, and chili oil.
                    <br><br>
                    There are many different variations of gyoza, with different fillings and cooking methods. Some common variations include shumai (open-faced dumplings), age-gyoza (deep-fried dumplings), and yaki-gyoza (pan-fried dumplings). Gyoza can also be filled with a variety of different ingredients, such as shrimp, chicken, mushrooms, and cabbage, among others.
                    <br><br>
                    Making gyoza at home can be a fun and rewarding experience, and there are many different recipes and variations available to try.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol class="info-list ol-list">
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground pork, garlic, ginger, green onions, cabbage, soy sauce, sesame oil, cornstarch, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are combined evenly.</li>
                    <li>Take one gyoza wrapper and place a tablespoon of the pork filling in the center. Wet the edges of the wrapper with water, then fold in half and press the edges together to seal. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.</li>
                    <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat, and add enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan.</li>
                    <li>Once the pan is hot, add the gyoza to the pan, flat side down. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the bottom is golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Pour the water into the pan and cover immediately with a lid. Let the gyoza steam for 5-6 minutes or until cooked through.</li>
                    <li>While the gyoza are cooking, make the dipping sauce by combining the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and chopped green onions in a small bowl.</li>
                    <li>Serve the gyoza hot with the dipping sauce on the side.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This recipe makes around 30 gyoza, but you can easily double or halve the recipe depending on how many you need. You can also experiment with different fillings and dipping sauces to create your own unique gyoza recipe!</p>
